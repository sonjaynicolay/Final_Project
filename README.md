# Final_Project

### Tools to Build our Models 
***

#### Machine Learning
For Machine Learning a supervised machine learning model through scikit-learn will be used. Data will be cleaned using .ipynb files in Google Colaboratory, .csvs will be stored using AWS, and a PostgresSQL server will be used to house tables for the Machine Learning model.

#### Visualization 
For visualization Tableau will be used to help visualize data and draw conclusions based on the ML model.
