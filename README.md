## Using supervised learning to determine the primary socio-economic factors that effect home prices in Illinois
---


### The Basis of our Analysis
***

#### Our Problem
Our real estate agency, The S.O.D.O. Agency, is currently looking to purchase investment properties in multiple Illinois counties. Grateful for a stable housing market during the pandemic, we want to continue to maximize our profits and purchase homes where home values are the highest and will more likely give us the best R.O.I. To help us make an informed decision, we want to evaluate the neighborhood's effect on house prices in each county/zip code.

#### Description of the Data Sources
- Zillow (zillow.com)
- US Census (census.gov)
- Department of Justice FBI (ucr.fbi.gov)

#### Communication Protocols
To most effectively achieve our agency goals in a timely manner. We plan to establish a project timeline that will allow us to review and triple check our work before our deadline. We also will utilize class time and schedule an additional day during the week to meet and make sure we are all on one accord. If necessary, we will attend office hours to sort out any issues we may run into that week. In between we will maintain communication and follow-up with each other via Slack messaging. 
Each member of the agency has created an individual work branch that is attached to the main branch of our project repository. We all will review pushes from individual branches in GitHub to the main branch to ensure we present an error-proof analysis.
